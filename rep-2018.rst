Abstract
========
Behavior Trees are a powerful tool in robot programming.
This document describes the behavior of commonly used control nodes.

Motivation
==========
This REP is not intending to enforce a certain standard for every and all behavior tree implementation.
Instead, the goal is to propose a common set of control nodes and their functionality in order to facilitate the analysis of behavior trees.
This would allow the formal verification of a program written in a behavior tree language.
Additionally, it allows static analysis of a given behavior tree, e.g. to detect deadlocks or infinite loops.

Structure
=========
The document is structured as follows:
- The first section describes the basic concepts of the execution of behavior trees.
- The second section describes the control nodes, leaf nodes and decorators.
- The third section describes requirements for the underlying actions and conditions that the leaf nodes interact with.
